# Obfuscation

**Obfuscation** is a method of intentionally complicating code to make it more difficult to analyze and understand. It is often used to protect intellectual property or to hide malicious code.

## Technologies Used

- **RandomForestClassifier** — a machine learning model consisting of multiple decision trees, which improves classification accuracy through voting.
  
- **TfidfVectorizer** — a tool for converting text into numerical representation, taking into account word frequency and uniqueness.

- **Model Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Precision** 
  - **Recall** 
  - **ROC AUC** 

- **Weights & Biases (wandb)** — a platform for tracking and visualizing experiments. It is used for logging metrics and analyzing model performance.
